# Major Project Reflection


# Challenges
I believe I faced two major challenges during the course of this project. My primary challenge was over committing to researching how to do things in one certain way and making it work, rather than exploring different options that would've worked better. This cost me a lot of time as I spent time reading and researching instead of actually making progress.

My second challenge was my own under estimation of the difficulty of what I wanted to do and my own lack of work ethic. I didn't use my time efficiently and thats apparent in the final product. I also really over-estimated my ability to complete elements of the project and didn't realize how difficult some aspects would be.

A final minor challenege was spending more time on aesthetics than I needed to.

# Solutions
Near the end of the project I realized I was wasting time with researching and more went ahead trying things, and that made me move along quicker, and I spent more time actually making progress but I believe it was too little too late.

Most of my actual code bugs I fixed within good time.


# What Would I Do Different
Next time I would like to look more into what actual content would be within the project I was doing and set the bar a little lower for myself. The main change would be just less time wasting and working on actually making progress. 


# Did I complete my Need To Have list
The short answer is no because in it's final state the game doesn't actually work. Of the things on my need to have list, I completed some of the more complicated ones but also didn't finish some of the more important ones. I think a few things on the list are fairly simple and easy to implement however, I just never actually did it. There is a very simple income system, towers can be placed, enemies do spawn, the rounds infinitely scale though just by one enemy per round, and I think the interface is pretty decent and easy to use. What I didn't complete was the important part of towers attacking enemies, though enemies can die via console.
